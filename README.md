# CTCdeb
My take on debian linux (Still alpha!)
As of right now all it is is debian 12 with Papirus, KDE, ZSH, Flatpak, Flathub, gnome-console, and Nala package manager.
It will look identical to debian because i did not change the config files yet but plan to in the future.
Have fun and feel free to make your own spins on it!
